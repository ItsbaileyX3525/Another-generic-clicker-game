# Another generic clicker game

It is what it is, it's just another generic clicker game that you can play for clicks and score and buy more upgrades to get more clicks and score and so on so forth.

### I know your secretes 

What secrets this game literally it just a clicker game there is nothing more to it...

I'm actually not joking...

## Why was this hard to make?

The game is hard to make due to taptapir (the game engine I used) not being the best, a lot of the logic I had to write myself but nevertheless I pulled through, below you can a snippet of what the code looks like.

Without autocomplete and linting (due to the custom language, its not python, it's python-like) it hindered the development time by a lot but I hope you like it anyways!
